Only fibonacci, morse_encoder, 99_bottles_of_beer, linked_list, tee, example-9,
example-11, example-12, example-insecure, example-addrstack,
example-shellcode1, example-shellcode2, example-hello-nasm are meant to be
executed from command-line.

The other programs are just examples of instruction encodings that are meant to
be examined with objdump or single-stepped in gdb. They do not call syscall
exit() to exit properly, so they will likely segmentation fault when execution
falls through outside of .text.
