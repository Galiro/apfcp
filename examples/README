Only example-4, example-7, example-10, example-12 are meant to be executed from
command-line.

The other programs are just examples of instruction encodings that are meant to
be examined with objdump or single-stepped in gdb. They do not call syscall
exit() to exit properly, so they will likely segmentation fault when execution
falls through outside of .text.
