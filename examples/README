Only fibonacci, morse_encoder, 99_bottles_of_beer, linked_list, example-13,
example-14, example-16, example-17, example-18, example-19, example-20,
example-21, and example-22 are meant to be executed from command-line.

The other programs are just examples of instruction encodings that are meant to
be examined with objdump or single-stepped in gdb. They do not call syscall
exit() to exit properly, so they will likely segmentation fault when execution
falls through outside of .text.
